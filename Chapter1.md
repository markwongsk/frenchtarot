# Chapitre Un: Basic Bidding Rules of Thumb
This chapter assumes prior knowledge of the basic rules of French Tarot.

## Evaluating the Strength of a Hand
In general, the strength of a hand depends on the following:

1. Number of Bouts.
2. Number of Trumps.
3. Number of Kings.
4. Presence of a long suit.
5. Presence of a void suit.
6. Presence of a singleton.
7. Number of potential winners (Usually more important in four and three player games).
8. Without posession of the 1, a viable way to fish it out.

## Five Player
Five player games are usually the ones with highest variance and volatility, due to the existence of an impromptu partnership, none of which either player of the partnership has control over (usually, there are two exceptions to this).

### Basic Rules of Thumb
#### 10 Bids
1. Posession of five Trumps (including the 21) and a King.

#### 20 Bids
1. Posession of four Trumps (including the 21 and the Joker) and no Kings.
2. Posession of five Trumps (including two Bouts) and no Kings, and the ability to make a void.

#### 40 Bids
