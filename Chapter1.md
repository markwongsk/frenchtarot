# Chapitre Un: Basic Bidding Rules of Thumb
This chapter assumes prior knowledge of the basic rules of French Tarot.

## Evaluating the Strength of a Hand
In general, the strength of a hand depends on the following:

1. Number of Bouts.
2. Number of Trumps.
3. Number of Kings.
4. Presence of a long suit.
5. Presence of a void suit.
6. Presence of a singleton.
7. Number of potential winners (Usually more important in four and three player games).
8. Without posession of the 1, a viable way to fish it out.

## Five Player
Five player games are usually the ones with highest variance and volatility, due to the existence of an impromptu partnership, none of which either player of the partnership has control over (usually, there are two exceptions to this).

### Basic Rules of Thumb for Opening Bids
#### 10 Bids
1. Posession of five Trumps (including the 21) and a King.
2. Posession of six Trumps (including the 1 or the Joker) and a King.

#### 20 Bids
1. Posession of four Trumps (including the 21 and the Joker) and no Kings.
2. Posession of five Trumps (including two Bouts) and no Kings, and the ability to make a void.

#### 40 Bids
1. Posession of five Trumps (including the 21 and the Joker) and a King.
2. Posession of five Trumps (including two Bouts) and a King, and the ability to make a void.

#### 80 Bids
1. Posession of six Trumps (including the 21 and the Joker) and two Kings.
2. Posession of six Trumps (including the 21 and the 1) and two Kings, and a natural void.
3. Posession of seven Trumps (including the 1 and the Joker) and two Kings, and a natural void.
4. Posession of six Trumps (including three Bouts) and a King, and a natural void.

#### 160 Bids
1. Presence of seven Trumps (including three Bouts) and two Kings, and a natural void.

### Advanced Opener Bids
These bids are in general riskier and require more things to fall in place, but in general have a positive payout if executed correctly over a large number of games.
#### 10 Bids
1. Eight Trumps with no Bouts, and two Kings.
  * Ideally, be able to void in the non-partner suit, and have a singleton in one of the King suits.
  * In general, will probably need to capture or secure the 1 to be able to make the contract.
  * As leader of first trick, probably lead a mid Trump (8-14) to try to flush out the high ones (and hopefully the 21). This also gains information on the potential Trump distribution among players, especially if a player undertrumps a mid-trump. Hopefully said player isn't your partner. The showing of a Joker on this trick also indicates that the player probably doesn't have the 1 or the 21, which is additional useful information.
  * Reason for leading a mid Trump is that low Trumps can be used on the void and singleton suit, so it is more useful to flush out the higher Trumps with a mid Trump.
  * If not the leader of the first trick, you will probably win the first trick (you have Kings in two suits, a void in the non-partner suit, and the partner suit cannot be led). If your partner leads his/her King, smack him/her if he/she does not follow-up with the 21.

#### 20 Bids
1. One Bout, two Kings
  * This is the (in)famous Russian Twenty bid
  * This is not a terminal bid.
  * Ideally opened as the first or second player, or on top of a 10 bid.
  * If posessing the 1, a way to defend it in case one does not get called. Otherwise, do not bid it. A viable defense is the possession of five or more trumps, or the presence of a natural void.
  * A Russian Twenty hand can make for good defense if posessing very few trumps and an imbalanced distribution, but there's always the possibility that you don't get picked up and end up having to play the bid.
